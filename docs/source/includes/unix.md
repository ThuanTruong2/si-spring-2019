# C++ on Unix

> Compiling a C++ program named "main.cpp"

```shell
    # Insert command here
```

```cpp
    // main.cpp
    #include <iostream>

    int main() {
        std::cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
    }
```

The projects in CPSC 131 are compiled and tested on a server running Linux. 
**[INSERT COMPILER NAME]** is used to compile the programs. 

Some useful flag for the command include:  
 - `-Wall` turns on almost every warning  
 - `-std=c++11` uses C++ 11 standards  
 - `-o` allows for the executable to be named  
 - `-g` adds debugger information to compiled file (necessary for debuggin)  

Chances are that you'll be interacting a lot more with the command line in 
this class. Here is a useful

bash commands
